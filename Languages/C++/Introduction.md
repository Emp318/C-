# What is C++
C++ is a cross-platform language (a programming language that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple operating systems or environments without needing significant modifications) that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.
