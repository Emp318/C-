C++ is used to create computer programs, and is one of the most used languages in game development. C++ was developed as an extension of C , and both languages have almost the same syntax. C++ is an object oriented language.
# What is C++
C++ is a cross-platform language (a programming language that allows developers to write code that can run on multiple operating systems or environments without needing significant modifications) that can be used to create high-performance applications. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory. The language was updated 5 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2023 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23.
# Uses of C++
- C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded Systems.
- C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
- C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
- C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
# Difference between C and C++
The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.
