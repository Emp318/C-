Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.
# Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). Any text between `//` and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed). This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

# Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`. Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the compiler:
