To start using C++, you need two things:
- A text editor, like Notepad, to write C++ code
- A compiler, like GCC to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer understand.
# C++ Install IDE
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit and compile the code. Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code. You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at `http://www.codeblocks.org/`. Download the `mingw-setup.exe` file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
# Quickstart
To create our first C++ file, open Codeblocks and go `File > New > Empty File`. Write the following C++ code and save the file as `myfirstprogram.cpp` (`File > New > Empty File`):

In Codeblocks, it should look like this:
