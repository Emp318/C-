A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be executed by a computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:

# Many Statements
Most C++ programs contain many statements. The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written:

From the example above, we have 3 statements:
- `cout << "Hello World!";`
- `cout << "Have a good day!";`
- `return 0;`
The first statement is executed first. Then the second statement is executed. And at last, the third statement is executed.
